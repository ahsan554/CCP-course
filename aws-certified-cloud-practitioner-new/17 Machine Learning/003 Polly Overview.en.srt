1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
<v Instructor>Polly is the opposite of transcribe.</v>

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,030
You turn text into speech using deep learning.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,910
This allows you to create applications that will talk.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,190
For example, it says, "Hello, my name is Stephane

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,380
and this is a demo of Amazon Polly."

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,600
And then, with Polly, it would generate an audio

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,280
which I can play right here.

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,380
<v Polly>Hi, my name is Stephane</v>

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,050
and this is a demo of Amazon Polly.

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,760
<v Instructor>I think I'm better at speaking than that,</v>

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,070
but (chuckles) this gives you a good demo, right?

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,950
And you can play with it on the console.

13
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,300
So let's go into the Amazon Polly console and try Polly.

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,950
And we can say, "Hi, my name is Stephane.

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,470
I love AWS courses,

16
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,680
and I love machine learning."

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,880
Okay. And then, you would just press listen.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,570
<v Polly>Hi, my name is Stephane.</v>

19
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,410
I love at AWS courses, and I love machine learning.

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,310
<v Instructor>Pretty cool, right?</v>

21
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,590
And if you wanted to have a more robot sounding voice,

22
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,960
you would use a standard engine.

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,360
<v Polly>Hi, my name is Stephane.</v>

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,350
I love AWS courses, and I love machine learning.

25
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,323
<v Instructor>And that's it. That's Polly.</v>
