00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,270
<v Instructor>Let's do a summary</v>

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,310
on what we learned for EC2.

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,490
So we have created EC2 Instances,

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,140
and they were composed of an AMI,

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,200
which was defining the operating system.

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,950
Then we defined an instance size

7
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,150
where we defined how much CPU power we want,

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,150
and how much RAM we want.

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,230
We described the storage for our EC2 Instance,

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,160
We defined the firewall on our instances

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,500
with the security groups,

12
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,610
and finally, a bootstrap script called the EC2 User Data

13
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,610
that was started when the EC2 Instance was started.

14
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,100
So the security groups are attached to EC2 Instances.

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,130
And they are a firewall outside of your instance.

16
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,340
And you can define rules to allow which ports

17
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,280
and which API can access your EC2 instance.

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,650
For EC2 User Data,

19
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,360
this was a script that we launched

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,380
at the first start of an instance

21
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,680
that we used to set up our EC2 instance

22
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,390
to be a web server and say "hello world".

23
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,540
SSH was a way for us to start a terminal

24
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,890
from our computers into our EC2 Instances,

25
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,670
to start issuing commands on port 22.

26
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,840
And once we did it,

27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,113
we were able to leverage an EC2 Instance role

28
00:01:07,113 --> 00:01:09,700
that was similar to IAM role,

29
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,060
to have our EC2 instance issue commands against IAM.

30
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,140
In terms of the EC2 purchasing options,

31
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,780
we have multiple options you need to know for the exam.

32
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,350
We have On-demand, Spot, Reserved in three flavors

33
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,620
of Standard, Convertible and Scheduled.

34
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,410
We have Dedicated Host and finally Dedicated Instances.

35
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,243
So that's it.

36
00:01:29,243 --> 00:01:30,076
I hope you liked it

37
00:01:30,076 --> 00:01:31,900
and I will see you in the next section.
