00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,500
<v Stephane>Let's talk about these firewalls</v>

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,520
around our EC2 instances.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,950
So we briefly configured one in the previous lecture

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,250
but security groups yet again, are going to be fundamental

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,690
into doing network security in the AWS cloud.

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,970
They will control how the traffic is allowed

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,600
into and out of your EC2 instances.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,210
Security groups are going to be very easy,

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,880
they only contain allow rules,

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,080
so we can say what is allowed to go in and to go out,

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,630
and security groups can have rules

12
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,690
that reference either by IP addresses,

13
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,280
so, where your computer is from

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,790
or by other security groups,

15
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,930
so as we'll see, security groups can reference each other.

16
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,940
So here, let's take an example,

17
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,340
we are on our computer, so we are on the public internet

18
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,910
and we're trying to access our EC2 instance

19
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,550
from our computer.

20
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,660
We are going to create a security group

21
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,510
around our EC2 instance,

22
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,500
that is the firewall that is around it

23
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,360
and then this security group is going to have rules.

24
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,980
And these rules are going to say

25
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,230
whether or not some inbound traffic,

26
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,730
so from the outside into the EC2 instance is allowed,

27
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,680
and also if the EC2 instance

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,530
can perform some outbound traffic.

29
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,690
So to talk from where it is into the internet.

30
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,180
Now let's do a deeper dive, right?

31
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,340
Security groups are a firewall on our EC2 instances

32
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,230
and they're going to regulate access to ports.

33
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,420
They're going to see the authorized IP ranges.

34
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,967
Would it be on IPv4 or IPv6?

35
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:28,380
These are the two kinds of IP on the internet,

36
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,580
and this is going to control the inbound network.

37
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,170
So from the outside to the instance

38
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,900
and the other network from the instance to the outside,

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,450
and when we look at security group rules,

40
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,820
they will look just like this.

41
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,470
So they will be the type, the protocol,

42
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,560
so TCP, the port allowing it,

43
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,610
so where the traffic can go through on the instance

44
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,900
and the source which represents an IP address range

45
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,010
and 0.0 0.0/0 means everything

46
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,610
and this here means just one IP.

47
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,680
So you're not expected to know

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,590
how to properly configure a security group

49
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,760
for the (indistinct) exam, but they're so important,

50
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,370
so I wanna talk about them.

51
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,010
Now, let's look at the diagram, right?

52
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,940
So we have our EC2 instance

53
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,640
and it has one security group allow attached to it

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,220
that has inbound rules and outbound rules.

55
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,330
So I've separated them onto this diagram.

56
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,420
So our computer is going to be authorized on say port 22.

57
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,950
So the traffic can go through from our computer

58
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,720
to the EC2 instance,

59
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,930
but someone else's computer, that's not using my IP address

60
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,760
because they don't live where I live,

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,240
then if they're trying to access our EC2 instance

62
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,700
they will not get through it

63
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,100
because the firewall is going to block it

64
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,610
and it will be a timeout.

65
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,700
Then for the outbound rules by default,

66
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,310
our EC2 instance for any security group

67
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,030
is going to be by default allowing any traffic out of it.

68
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,300
So our EC2 instance,

69
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,720
if it tries to access a website and initiate a connection

70
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,710
it is going to be allowed by the security group.

71
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,930
So this is the basics of how the firewall works.

72
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,790
Now good to know,

73
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,630
what do you need to know with security groups?

74
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,780
Well, they can be attached to multiple instances, okay?

75
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,570
There's not a one to one relationship

76
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,930
between security group and instances

77
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,490
and actually an instance

78
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,030
can have multiple security groups too.

79
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,125
Security groups are locked down to a region

80
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,370
/VPC combination, okay?

81
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,860
So if you switch to another region,

82
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,040
you have to create a new security group

83
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,040
or if you create another VPC

84
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,810
and we'll see what VPCs are in the like later lecture,

85
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,040
well, you have to recreate the security groups.

86
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,380
The security groups live outside the EC2.

87
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,270
So as I said, if the traffic is blocked

88
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,160
the EC2 instance won't even see it.

89
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,900
Okay, it's not like an application running on EC2

90
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,140
it's really a firewall outside your EC2 instance.

91
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,100
To be honest, and that's just an advice to you

92
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,730
from developer to developer

93
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,210
but it's good to maintain one separate security group

94
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,720
just for SSH access,

95
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,010
usually SSH access is the most complicated thing

96
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,650
and you really wanna make sure that one is done correctly.

97
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,880
So I usually separate my security group

98
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,283
for SSH access separately.

99
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,660
If your application is not accessible, so timeout,

100
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,350
so we saw this in the last lecture,

101
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,830
then it is a security group issue.

102
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,890
Okay, so if you try to connect to any port

103
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,311
and you computer just hangs and waits and waits

104
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:08,910
that's probably a security group issue,

105
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,830
but if you receive a connection refused error,

106
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,930
okay, you actually get a response and connection refused,

107
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,030
then the security group actually worked,

108
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,830
the traffic went through and the application was errored

109
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,930
or it wasn't launched or something like this.

110
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,930
So this is what you would get

111
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,800
if you get a connection refused.

112
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,350
By default, all inbound traffic is blocked

113
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,830
and all outbound traffic is authorized, okay?

114
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,650
Now there is a small advanced feature

115
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,910
that I really, really like, and I think it's perfect

116
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,390
if you start using load balancers

117
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,150
and we'll see this in the next lecture as well,

118
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,440
which is how to reference security groups

119
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,860
from other security groups.

120
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,600
So let me explain things.

121
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,230
So we have an EC2 instance, and it has a security group,

122
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,509
what I call group number one,

123
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:50,950
and the inbound rules is basically saying,

124
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,530
I'm authorizing security group number one inbound

125
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,390
and security group number two.

126
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,130
So, why would we even do this?

127
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,670
Well, if we launch another EC2 instance

128
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,920
and it has security group two attached to it,

129
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,830
well, by using the security group (indistinct) rule

130
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,890
that we just set up,

131
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,640
we basically allow our EC2 instance

132
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,550
to go connect straight through on the port we decided

133
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,980
onto our first EC2 instance.

134
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,650
Similarly, if we have another EC2 instance

135
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,530
with a security group one attached,

136
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,540
while we've also authorized this one

137
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,160
to communicate straight back to our instances.

138
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,030
And so regardless of the IP of our EC2 instances

139
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,840
because they have the right security group attached to them

140
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,820
they're able to communicate straight through

141
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,150
to other instances.

142
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,680
And that's awesome because it doesn't make you think

143
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,210
about IPs all the time.

144
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,680
And if you have another EC2 instance

145
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,380
maybe with security group number three attached to it,

146
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,760
well, because it group number three

147
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,970
wasn't authorized in the inbound rules

148
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,430
of security group number one,

149
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,130
then it's being denied and things don't work.

150
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,850
So that's a bit of an advanced feature

151
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,910
but we'll see it when we'll deal load balancers

152
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,640
'cause it's quite a common pattern.

153
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,660
I just want you to know about it,

154
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,390
again just remember this diagram

155
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,460
and by now you should be really, really good

156
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,720
at security groups and understand them correctly.

157
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,470
Now going into the exam, what ports you need to know?

158
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,220
Well, we need to know something called SSH

159
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,710
or Secure Shell and we're going to see this

160
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,320
in the very next lectures.

161
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,570
This is the port 22.

162
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,570
And this allows you to login to an EC2 instance on Linux.

163
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,590
You have port 21 for FTP or File Transfer Protocol

164
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,370
which is used to upload files into a file share.

165
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,080
And you have SFTP, which is also using port 22, why?

166
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, because we're going to upload file

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,610
but this time using SSH

168
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,970
because it's going to be a Secure File Transfer Protocol.

169
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,970
Then we have port 80 for HTTP

170
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,880
and we've been using it in the previous lecture.

171
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,120
This is to access unsecured websites.

172
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,990
And you've seen this whenever you go on the internet

173
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,990
and you enter HTTP:// and then the address of the website.

174
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,210
And you've seen it most likely a lot more like this,

175
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,650
you've seen HTTPS, which is to access secured websites

176
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,470
which are the standard nowadays.

177
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,760
And for HTTPS, it is port 443.

178
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,170
Finally, the last port you need to remember

179
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:09,170
is 3389 for RDP, or the Remote Desktop Protocol

180
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,120
which is the port that's used

181
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,610
to log into a windows instance, okay?

182
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,850
So 22 is SSH for Linux instance

183
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,170
but 3389 is RDP for a windows instance.

184
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,430
Now this is all the theory about security groups.

185
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,080
I will see you in the next lecture for some practice.
