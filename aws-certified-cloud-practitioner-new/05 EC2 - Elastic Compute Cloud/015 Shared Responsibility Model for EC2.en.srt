00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,430
<v Narrator>Now again,</v>

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,300
one more reminder into the Shared Responsibility Model

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,840
and how this applies for EC2.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,530
So AWS is going to be responsible for all data centers,

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,260
their infrastructure and the security of them,

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,580
then AWS is going to be responsible

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,530
for making sure you have isolation on the physical host,

8
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,363
if you're getting,

9
00:00:19,363 --> 00:00:22,690
for example, a dedicated host or replacing faulty hardware

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,650
if one of their servers is failing,

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,510
or making sure they are still compliant with the regulations

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,060
that they have agreed to.

13
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,420
But you as a user,

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,010
you're responsible for the security in the cloud.

15
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,070
So that means that you define your own security group rules.

16
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,920
And this allows you or other people to access

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,420
or not your EC2 instances.

18
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,680
You own the entire virtual machine

19
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,510
inside of your EC2 instance.

20
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,810
So that means that your operating system will be Windows

21
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,280
or Linux, all the patches and the updates.

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,707
You have to do them not AWS.

23
00:00:53,707 --> 00:00:55,490
AWS will give you the virtual machine.

24
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,587
It's up to you to handle it the way you want.

25
00:00:57,587 --> 00:00:59,491
That means that all the software

26
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:02,750
and the utilities that are installed on this EC2 instance,

27
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,220
also are yours to be responsible for.

28
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,580
Finally, understanding how to assign AM Roles

29
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,580
and make sure the permissions are correct.

30
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,140
And finally, making sure data is secure on your instance

31
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,950
is also very important for your EC2 instances.

32
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,783
So that's it.

33
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:20,850
Hope that again puts a bit of perspective

34
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,169
on to the shared responsibility model for EC2

35
00:01:23,169 --> 00:01:25,263
and I will see you in the next lecture.
