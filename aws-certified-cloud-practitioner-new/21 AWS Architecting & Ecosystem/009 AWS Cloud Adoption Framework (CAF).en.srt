1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,050
<v Instructor>So now let's discuss</v>

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,100
the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework also called CAF.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,860
And this is something that is coming up at the exam

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,590
and you will have to remember a few things by heart

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,910
but hopefully by the end

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,920
of this lecture it should start to make sense.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,870
So CAF is basically an ebook.

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,980
It's a white paper, and so at such, it's not a service

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,950
but the cloud adoption framework will help you

10
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,431
build and then execute a comprehensive plan to

11
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:27,570
do your digital transformation

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,940
through the innovative use of AWS.

13
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,970
So how to leverage a cloud to be transformed.

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,680
So it was created by AWS

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,650
by the professionals and its best practices

16
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,800
grouping thousands of customers all in one framework.

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,700
So the CAF has two components, I would say.

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,689
The first one is called organizational capabilities that

19
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:52,110
could be underpinning successful platform transformations.

20
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,610
And the second one is

21
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,020
that these capabilities are regrouped into six perspectives

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,240
and these six perspectives you have to remember

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,230
for the exam.

24
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,800
So we have business, people, governance, platform security

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,500
and operations, and then we'll go over them a little bit

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,600
for you to understand what they're about.

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,510
So we can divide them into, two categories.

28
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,870
The first one is the business capability.

29
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,550
And so we have the three pillars.

30
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,680
So we have the business perspective first.

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,870
And this business perspective helps ensure

32
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,360
that your cloud investments accelerate your

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,320
digital transformation, ambitions and business outcomes.

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,720
The people perspective is a second perspective

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,940
within the business umbrella, and it serves

36
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,010
as a bridge between technology and business.

37
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,780
Very important to remember for the exam.

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,490
This is a question that can be asked of you

39
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,890
and it helps you accelerate the cloud journey to

40
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,780
help organizations more rapidly evolve

41
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,660
to culture of continuous growth, learning

42
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,300
and where change becomes business as normal.

43
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,910
And so through the people you have a focus on culture

44
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,600
organizational structure, leadership and workforce.

45
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,420
And finally we have the governance perspective

46
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,700
which helps you orchestrate your cloud initiatives

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,760
while maximizing the organizational benefits

48
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,640
and minimizing transformation related risks.

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,920
So business people and governance

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,090
with people being the bridge

51
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,560
between technology and business.

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,320
And so within each of these perspectives

53
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,180
we have the capabilities.

54
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,560
And so for business

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,630
we have capabilities that are related to business.

56
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,470
You don't have to remember them

57
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,030
but it's good to look at them.

58
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,430
So strategy management, portfolio management

59
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,650
innovation management, product management

60
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,010
strategic partnership, data monetization, business insight

61
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,330
and data science.

62
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,100
For people, we have anything with two people.

63
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,920
So culture, evolution, transformational leadership,

64
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,740
cloud fluency, workforce transformation,

65
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,360
change acceleration

66
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,870
organization design and organizational alignment.

67
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,703
And for governance

68
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:47,190
we have program and project management, benefits management

69
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,781
risk management, cloud financial management

70
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:52,020
application portfolio management

71
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,630
data governance and data curation.

72
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,790
So that's for the business capabilities.

73
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,040
Regrouped under the three business perspectives

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,800
of business, people and governance.

75
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,190
And then we have what's called the technical capabilities.

76
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,420
So the technical capabilities are platform, security

77
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,950
and operations.

78
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,270
And platform helps you build an enterprise grade scalable

79
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,990
hybrid cloud platform to modernize your existing workloads

80
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,532
and to implement new cloud native solutions.

81
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:24,540
From the security perspective

82
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,000
it helps you achieve the confidentiality

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,740
integrity and availability of your data and cloud workloads.

84
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,320
And finally, from an operations perspective

85
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,560
it helps you ensure that your cloud services are delivered

86
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,830
at a level that meets the needs of your business.

87
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:41,663
So now if you look

88
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:44,550
at individual capabilities within these perspectives

89
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,920
we have platform security and operations.

90
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,110
So for platform, we have platform architecture

91
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,500
data architecture, platform engineering, data engineering

92
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,300
provisioning and orchestration

93
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,920
modern application development

94
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,400
and continuous integration and continuous delivery.

95
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,830
So for security, we have anything related to security

96
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,920
of course, such as security governance, security assurance

97
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,890
identity and access management, threat detection

98
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,680
vulnerability management, infrastructure position

99
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,990
data protection, application security

100
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,490
and incident response.

101
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,900
And finally, operations is all

102
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,220
around the operations review in the cloud.

103
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,400
So we're talking about observability, event management

104
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,410
incidents and problem management

105
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,600
change and release management, performance

106
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,480
and capacity management, configuration management

107
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,540
patch management, availability and continuity management.

108
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,450
And finally, application management.

109
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,182
So the goal is really when you go

110
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:39,090
at the exam to really understand what are

111
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,000
the perspectives that regroup these capabilities.

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,430
So you definitely have to remember business, people

113
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,860
governance, platform security and operations

114
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,390
because there will be something asked

115
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,150
of you and maybe sometime you will have to

116
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,820
identify a specific capability

117
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,730
and associate it with the correct perspective.

118
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,920
But if you look at the list we just went over

119
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,200
usually it makes sense, what is related to security?

120
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,690
Sounds like security, what is related to business

121
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,795
sounds like business and so on.

122
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:08,940
Now, there's one last part in this little diagram right here

123
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,320
which is the transformation domain.

124
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,010
So we have technology, process, organization, and products

125
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,500
and that helps you drive business outcomes.

126
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,470
And some questions at the exam can be geared

127
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,640
towards these transformation domains.

128
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,710
So I'm also gonna go over this.

129
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,450
So these four transformation domains.

130
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,280
The first one is technology.

131
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,350
So we use the cloud to migrate

132
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,620
and modernize legacy infrastructure, applications

133
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,930
data and analytics platforms.

134
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,120
For process, we want to be digitizing everything

135
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,270
automating and optimizing your business operations.

136
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,600
That means you want to two things, leverage new data

137
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,880
and analytics platform to create actionable insights

138
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,110
thanks to the cloud.

139
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,930
And using machine learning to improve your customer

140
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,280
service experience.

141
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,160
This is all thanks to the cloud, for organization.

142
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,890
How do you reimagine your operating model?

143
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,041
So for this, we want to reorganize the teams

144
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,840
around the products and the value streams

145
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,090
and you want to leverage agile methods

146
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,190
to rapidly iterate and evolve.

147
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,390
This is something that can be asked

148
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,610
for at the exam as per my experience.

149
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,460
And finally, for products, re-imagining your business model

150
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,320
by creating new value propositions such

151
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,690
as product and services and revenue models.

152
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,000
So all this thanks to the cloud.

153
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,130
Finally, CAF has transformation phases

154
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,240
that you need to know about.

155
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,470
There are four of them.

156
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,300
The first one is envision.

157
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,760
This is when you want to demonstrate how the cloud is

158
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,864
going to accelerate your business outcomes

159
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:31,331
by identifying transformation opportunities

160
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:35,430
and create a foundation for your digital transformation.

161
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,930
Then you have the align phase.

162
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,150
This is where you look at the six CAF perspectives

163
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,810
we've seen, and we identify capability gaps

164
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,300
and this will result in an action plan.

165
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,500
Then we have a launch

166
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,090
where we actually build and deliver

167
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,730
pilot initiatives in production and demonstrate

168
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,400
incremental business value, and finally

169
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,130
scale to expand these pilot initiatives with

170
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,120
desired scale while realizing the desired business benefits.

171
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,250
So the exam also is going to ask you

172
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,620
about these four transformation phases.

173
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,120
So be ready to know about them.

174
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,953
It's pretty easy.

175
00:07:06,953 --> 00:07:08,863
Envision is about making sure you have

176
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:11,160
identified business opportunities.

177
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,210
Then align is to align those to the CAF perspectives

178
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,100
to find gaps and have an action plan.

179
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,430
And then launch and scale are pretty explicit.

180
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,250
So CAF may seem like a very obscure framework

181
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,860
and to be honest, it's something you kinda have to just look

182
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,430
at and follow when you're doing your cloud adoption.

183
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,252
Now, from an exam perspective, again, I want to reassure you

184
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,950
you're going to be asked about the perspectives

185
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,340
and identifying which one is part of the framework or not.

186
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,664
You may be asked to identify

187
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:44,190
if a capability belongs to a specific perspective.

188
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,780
And finally, you may be asked

189
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,410
about these transformation domains and their phases

190
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,360
but all these things kind of make sense

191
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,790
by elimination when you go through at the exam.

192
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,283
So even if you don't remember by heart what these are

193
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:59,190
just remember that by using a little bit

194
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,280
of brain power and elimination, you will get there.

195
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,380
Okay, so that's it for this lecture.

196
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,213
I hope you liked it.

197
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:07,740
I did my best to explain this framework to you.

198
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,933
And I will see you in the next lecture.
