1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,830
<v Instructor>So we are going to first define</v>

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,270
a password policy.

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,590
For this click on Account Settings

4
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,730
on the left hand side.

5
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,580
You will find Password Policy and you can edit it.

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,920
So here we can use the IAM default password policy

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,190
which composes of these kind of requirements,

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,980
or we can customize the password policy

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,170
and force a password minimum length.

10
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,150
We can also require uppercase letter,

11
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,380
lowercase letter, a number, a non-alphanumeric character.

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,180
We can also turn on password expiration

13
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,000
to turn on, for example, expire after 90 days,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,160
or that a password expiration

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,750
requires administrative resets,

16
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,690
or we can allow the users to change their own password,

17
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,300
or we can prevent password reuse.

18
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,430
So this password can be edited directly

19
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,370
from the IAM console, and that's the first part of security.

20
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,420
The second part is around

21
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,000
setting multi-factor authentication

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,320
for your root account.

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,290
So if you click on the account name

24
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,050
and then click on Security Credentials,

25
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,930
if you are logged in with the root user

26
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,260
you will see My Security Credentials, Root User.

27
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,820
You will not have access to this

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,040
if you're not logged in with a root user.

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,690
Now, there is a way for you

30
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,670
to actually protect your root user,

31
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,470
which is the most important account in your AWS accounts,

32
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,010
and you can protect it by using multi-factor authentication.

33
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,020
Now, just so you know, I'm going to do it

34
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,120
and demonstrate how it works in front of you,

35
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,220
but I've had students who locked themselves

36
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,890
out of their accounts because they lost access

37
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,380
to their multi-factor authentication device.

38
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,350
As such, if you think you are running the risk

39
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,500
of losing your iPhone or whatever, do not do this.

40
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,560
Just keep your phone with you, just watch my video.

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,400
It will be good enough.

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,980
If you want to practice along with me, you can as well.

43
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,640
And you can also delete the MFA device after activating it.

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,180
Okay, but let's go ahead and assign an MFA device.

45
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,610
So I will call this one my iPhone

46
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,660
because this is what I have,

47
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,300
but you can name it whatever you want.

48
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,100
Then you can select the type of MFA device.

49
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,900
So it could be an authenticator app,

50
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,400
which is something I'm going to use,

51
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,230
but also it can be a security key

52
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,080
or a hardware TOTP token.

53
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,700
So I'm going to use an authenticator app

54
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,290
because it will be virtual.

55
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,050
And now we go into the setup of the app.

56
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,140
So there's a list of compatible applications right here

57
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,690
that you can find here for Android and for iOS

58
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,150
that we know work well with AWS.

59
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,110
And as such I'm going to use the Twilio Authy Authenticator,

60
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,460
which is an app I like.

61
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,900
And that's something that can be used

62
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,660
on your computer, on your devices, so it's kind of nice.

63
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,060
So what I have to do then is actually

64
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,860
launch the app on my phone,

65
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,290
and then you click on Show QR Code.

66
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,250
So when you show the QR code

67
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,340
you need to scan this QR code directly on your phone.

68
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,170
So for this you add an account,

69
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,050
you scan the QR code right here,

70
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,870
and once scanned it will add the account

71
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,190
and start naming it.

72
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,200
So we'll just save this, this looks good.

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,090
And then we get access to MFA codes.

74
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,440
So there is the first MFA code,

75
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,220
so 301935.

76
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,790
So this is a code generated by my iPhone in real time.

77
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,620
And this code is going to change over time.

78
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,410
And the reason why the two codes are asked by AWS

79
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,930
is that it wants to make sure that the MFA device

80
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,020
is set up correctly, and that the codes are accurate.

81
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,380
So the second code is 792843.

82
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,710
And, of course, they will be different for your device.

83
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,070
And once these two codes are entered, you click on Add MFA.

84
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,060
And as you can see

85
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,940
we can register up to eight MFA devices currently.

86
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,310
And you can scroll down and see them right here on the list.

87
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,550
So the multi-factor authentication MFA 1

88
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,680
is called my iPhone that's been created right now.

89
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,830
So if you wanted to remove it, you can remove it, and so on.

90
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,420
But so how do you use MFA?

91
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,800
Well now if I log out of AWS and I log back in,

92
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,803
so I'm going to use my root account and my password.

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,100
Now after doing a successful login

94
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,170
I have the MFA code to enter.

95
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,310
And so I open my app

96
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,720
and enter the code that I see, and press Submit.

97
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,090
And this way I am logged in.

98
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,380
And this is perfect because well

99
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,230
we add an extra level of security on our account.

100
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,670
So that's it for this lecture.

101
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,720
I hope you liked it,

102
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,703
and I will see you in the next lecture.
