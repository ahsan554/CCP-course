00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,390
<v Lecturer>Let's generate a credential report.</v>

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,360
So, on the bottom left,

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,160
I am going to create a credential report.

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,580
And I can click on Download Report

5
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,980
to just download this report and this will be a CSV file.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,470
Now, this CSV, because I'm using a training account

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,850
is not fascinating.

8
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,460
But as we can see, we have two rows in it.

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,700
We have my root account, and my account named stephane.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,150
We can see when the user was created,

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,750
if the password was enabled,

12
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,930
When the password was last used, and last changed.

13
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,940
When is the next rotation to be expected

14
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,370
if we do enable password rotation.

15
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,580
Is mfa active?

16
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,980
So we can see it's active for my root account,

17
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,680
but it is not active for my stephane account.

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,210
Then access keys, are they generated or not?

19
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,150
Yes, they are created for my stephane account,

20
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,570
but not for my root account.

21
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,400
And when were they last rotated, last used, and so on.

22
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,100
You can get more information about other access keys

23
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,800
and certificates and so on.

24
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,440
So this report is extremely helpful

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,370
if you want to look at some users

26
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,810
that haven't been changing their password,

27
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,390
or using it or their account.

28
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,187
It could be giving you a great way to find which users

29
00:01:03,187 --> 00:01:06,790
that deserve your attention from a security standpoint.

30
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,310
Next, I want to look at IAM Access Advisors,

31
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,200
so I'm going to click on my user.

32
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,680
My user is stephane,

33
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,070
and the right hand side it says Access Advisor.

34
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,480
So this is going to show me

35
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,790
when some services were last used.

36
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,700
And the recent activity usually appears within four hours.

37
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,050
So if you don't see all the data, that's why.

38
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,400
So we can see that, for example,

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,470
Identity and Access Management was last accessed today.

40
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,830
Thanks to this policy right here.

41
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,709
And also the Health APIs and Notifications

42
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:37,340
were accessed today.

43
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,417
Why?

44
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:39,250
Well this is a little bell right here,

45
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,430
automatically will be accessed

46
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,560
to see if there are any notifications for your accounts.

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,450
And we'll see what this is,

48
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,770
this is the Personal Health Dashboard, okay.

49
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,458
But for the other services, for example,

50
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:50,880
Alexa for Business, or AWS Accounts,

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,180
or Certificates Manager, I haven't been using them.

52
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,130
And so maybe it makes sense for me

53
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,130
to remove these permissions from this user,

54
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,000
because it seems this user is not using these services.

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,510
So this is the whole power of Access Advisor.

56
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,120
And as you can see there are lots of services in AWS.

57
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,560
About 23 pages just like this,

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,580
so this is about 230 services in AWS

59
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,000
at the time of recording.

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,060
So quite a lot to learn, but don't worry,

61
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,170
we'll get to cover it.

62
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,970
And we've just seen all the ways

63
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,430
we can have security tools on IAM.

64
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,390
I hope you like this lecture,

65
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,340
and I will see you in the next lecture.
