1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,970
<v Instructor>Okay, so let's explore the IAM console.</v>

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,290
For this, I just type IAM

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,770
and I go straight into the IAM console.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,920
So this is where we're going to be managing our account.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,030
And as you can see

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,970
from the top right corner, it says Global.

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,790
That means that this does not require a region selection

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,370
and IAM is a global service.

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,660
So no matter where you are,

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,880
you will have the same users across all your regions.

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,080
That makes sense.

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,850
Next, what we're going to do is to go ahead

13
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,800
and create our first users.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,290
So you can disregard any of these messages right now.

15
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,730
Don't worry about them.

16
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,250
And we go under Users and on user,

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,320
we're going to add a user.

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,820
So why do we need users?

19
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,710
Well, that's because we're using the root account.

20
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,570
If I go on the top right, as you can see,

21
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,070
it just gives me my account ID.

22
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,870
So that means I'm using the root account

23
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,610
and it has too much permissions.

24
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,460
And so what I want to do is instead to create admin users

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,240
and regular users and use them within AWS.

26
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,683
So let's go and create our first user.

27
00:00:55,683 --> 00:00:57,930
It's going to be named Stephane,

28
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,910
and I want to provide myself access

29
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,620
to the management console.

30
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,630
As you can see right now, there's an option says,

31
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,310
Hey, do you want to use a user

32
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,240
in Identity Center?

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,710
That's the recommended way,

34
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,978
or do you want to create an IAM user?

35
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:12,780
I'm going to go against the recommendations of AWS

36
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,550
because right now, from an exam perspective,

37
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,320
you need to know about IAM users

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,290
and the Identity Center is a bit more complicated to set up.

39
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,420
But don't worry, this does not affect your course

40
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,730
and you will learn everything you need to know for the exam.

41
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,140
So please bear with me

42
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,110
and follow along by creating an IAM user.

43
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:28,980
So you scroll down

44
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,560
and then you have to have a console password.

45
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,330
Now, if this was for someone else,

46
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,980
I would use an auto-generated password

47
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,850
but because this is for me,

48
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,780
I can just enter a password that I know of.

49
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,880
And you need to make sure that you are complaint

50
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,010
with the rules of the password right here.

51
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,290
Then I can disable this box

52
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,180
because I don't need to create a new password at sign in.

53
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,260
But I would do this

54
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,110
if it was another user I'm creating an account for.

55
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,260
Then you click on Next.

56
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,400
Okay, so next, we need to add a user

57
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,730
to group or attach permissions to it directly.

58
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,070
But we're going to create groups because it's much easier.

59
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,360
So let's create a group.

60
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,730
And this group name is going to be admin.

61
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,880
And the admin group is going to have one policy attached

62
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,980
called AdministratorAccess.

63
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,680
So you take this one, you scroll all the way down

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,050
and you click on Create user group.

65
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,840
So now the user can be added to the group admin

66
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,730
and because we will be in this admin group,

67
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,070
we will inherit the policies of that group,

68
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,950
which is AdministratorAccess.

69
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,920
Click on Next. Here we can review and create the user.

70
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,990
As you can see, you have optional tags.

71
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,270
Tags are everywhere in AWS.

72
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,690
They can help to include some extra information

73
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,523
about your data

74
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:40,290
but they don't impact how your account is functioning.

75
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,360
For example, I could enter a tag

76
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,500
and say that the department of Stephane is engineering.

77
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,420
This is the kind of usage for tags, but again,

78
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,840
it's just information you can add for users, for groups

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,243
and pretty much any resources within AWS.

80
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:56,790
So I will just show you how to do it once

81
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,920
but I won't do it everywhere.

82
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,840
Okay, so let's create this user.

83
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,410
Now, the user is successfully created, and what I can do

84
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,050
is that I can email the sign in instruction.

85
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,360
I can download the CSV to have the username

86
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,250
and the password, or I can click here

87
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,680
and return to the user list.

88
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,660
And now let's explore what we have created.

89
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,410
So under user groups, I will find the group admin

90
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,870
and if I click on it, I can see that there's one user

91
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,300
in this group, which is the Stephane user.

92
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,940
And if I look at the group permissions, as we can see,

93
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,590
there's a policy name attached to the group,

94
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,450
which is the administrator access,

95
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,070
which provides full admin access

96
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,930
to any users within the group.

97
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,410
And so if we go and click on the user, Stephane,

98
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,450
so this is a user you can also get back from this menu

99
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,350
on the left-hand side and just click on user Stephane.

100
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,470
Okay, so if you click on the user, Stephane, back to it.

101
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,640
Okay, great.

102
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,700
We have these permissions, and the permissions associated

103
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,142
with my user is AdministratorAccess

104
00:03:53,142 --> 00:03:55,500
and this is a managed policy that we inherited

105
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,090
from the group admin.

106
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,880
Okay, so we have our users and we have our groups

107
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,750
and now we're going to see how to log in

108
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,640
with that user Stephane.

109
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,190
So to do so, let's go back into the dashboard.

110
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,630
And on the right-hand side of the dashboard,

111
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,910
we have some summary about our AWS account.

112
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,590
So the account ID is right here,

113
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,600
which you can also get by opening this panel.

114
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,140
So this is the same account ID here and here,

115
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,920
and the account alias is what you can set to log in

116
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,790
to your account faster

117
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,520
because remembering numbers sometimes is difficult.

118
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,410
So you can create an account alias

119
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,330
and you just have to specify an alias that you like.

120
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,230
For example, stephane-aws--v2, and click on Save Changes.

121
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,450
Now, this is a unique alias for my account.

122
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,960
You're not gonna be able to use this alias for your account,

123
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,460
but you can create your own.

124
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,530
And now we have a sign in URL

125
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,710
on the right-hand side that is customized for my alias.

126
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,440
So if I click on copy this URL,

127
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,060
I need to open it in a new tab,

128
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,470
but it must be an incognito tab or a different web browser.

129
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,170
So here I've opened a private window in Firefox,

130
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,030
which is going to be a different session.

131
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,010
And so therefore, I can copy you the sign in URL

132
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,530
and paste it here and press enter.

133
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,040
Now we are taken again to the login page of AWS

134
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,800
and as we can see, we have three fields in a row.

135
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,480
We have the account ID, the IAM username, and the password.

136
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,560
So what's happening here is that we, using this URL,

137
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,590
are taken to a sign in page as an IAM user.

138
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,460
And how do we know this?

139
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,620
How can we get back to this page if you wanted to?

140
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,850
Well, when we went into the sign in,

141
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,560
we had two options, either root user

142
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,800
which will log you in as a root user or IAM user

143
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,470
in which case, you just need to enter the account ID

144
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,820
or the account alias.

145
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,080
And then click on Next,

146
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,480
which will take you into the page we had from before,

147
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,663
which was this page right here.

148
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,663
So now in this page,

149
00:05:44,663 --> 00:05:46,770
what I need to do is to enter my IAM username

150
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,080
and the password that I just created,

151
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,613
and then click on sign in.

152
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,170
And we are now logged in as an IAM user in the console.

153
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,370
So how do we know this?

154
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,590
Well, if you're logged in as a root user, as you can see

155
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,580
when you click on the account

156
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,260
it says My account and the account number.

157
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,580
This is a root user.

158
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,260
But if we go on the right-hand side, we can see

159
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,530
that there is Stephane@ and then the account alias.

160
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,180
And so what we can see is that Stephane

161
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,920
is the IAM user Stephane,

162
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,440
and then we're at my accounts and the account number.

163
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,460
So we know on the right-hand side

164
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,320
that we're logged in as an IAM user.

165
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,249
Now, this IAM user can do pretty much anything

166
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:20,910
that the other user was able to do, the root user

167
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,469
because they're both admins, okay?

168
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:25,080
But from a course perspective, it's better

169
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,500
if you use an IAM user than using the root account.

170
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,600
Now, you will see in some videos, I have the root user,

171
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,250
in some videos, I have the IAM user.

172
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,350
It doesn't really matter from a course perspective, okay?

173
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,350
So I will use them as I please.

174
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,460
But if I need to use the root user specifically,

175
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,420
I will let you know.

176
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,310
Or if I need to use an IAM user specifically,

177
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,900
I will let you know as well, okay?

178
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,520
But just so you know, to keep on going this section,

179
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,080
please have the root account,

180
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,110
as well as your IAM user ready and available.

181
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,040
So that's it for this lecture.

182
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,040
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
