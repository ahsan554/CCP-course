1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,070
<v Instructor>So on the left hand side of IAM,</v>

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,460
there are roles

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,910
and you may see zero roles.

4
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,000
Right now I have six,

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,720
it's because I use a different kind of account.

6
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,850
So don't worry about it.

7
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,420
Okay. It doesn't matter for this hands on, but we have roles

8
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,010
and roles allow entities in the AWS to get credentials

9
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,290
for a short duration and to do whatever they need to do.

10
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,123
So let's go ahead

11
00:00:19,123 --> 00:00:21,610
and create our first role and we'll have the same thing.

12
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,240
So we are going to choose a trusted entity type.

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,180
And as we can see, we have different types.

14
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,940
So we can create roles for either services, if you will.

15
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,210
There are also accounts with identities, SAML Federation

16
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,680
custom trust policy.

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,130
All of these are out of scope for the exam.

18
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,100
The only thing we need to know

19
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,900
even for the hands on is just

20
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,680
that we can create role for AWS services and amongst them

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,300
the two most common use cases is to create a role

22
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,250
for an EC2 instance or for Lambda function.

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,110
But as you can see, you go here.

24
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,530
There are lots of AWS services

25
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,290
that can support having roles, okay.

26
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,030
And the roles are everywhere in AWS.

27
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,570
But to keep it simple right now

28
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,230
we are going to create a role,

29
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,800
an IAM role for the EC2 instances.

30
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,670
So let's click on next.

31
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,970
Okay. Next I'm going to have to assign policies

32
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,730
and permissions to that role.

33
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,890
So we will allow that role to do

34
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,530
IAM read only access.

35
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,170
This is going to allow my EC2 instance to read

36
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,920
from IAM.

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,160
We click on next?

38
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,490
And then we have to define a role name.

39
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,730
Okay. So you choose whatever you want for role name

40
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,293
for example, I will enter demo role for EC2.

41
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,230
And then we verify that, yes

42
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,610
we did have the IAM read only access

43
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,680
and we create this role.

44
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,980
So the role has now been created.

45
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,302
And if I click on it

46
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,900
we can verify that the permissions are applied correctly,

47
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,780
the IAM read only access.

48
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,610
And we are not going to use this role right now.

49
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,730
We will stop right here.

50
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,110
But when we get to the EC2 section of this course

51
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,490
we will be leveraging this role

52
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,280
allowing the EC2 instance to perform actions

53
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,420
against IAM and read data from IAM okay.

54
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,410
So that's it for this lecture.

55
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,470
I hope you liked it.

56
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,420
And I will see you in the next lecture.
