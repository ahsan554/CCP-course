00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,750
<v ->Throughout the CCP exam, you are going</v>

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,660
to get a lot of questions on something called

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,754
Shared Responsibility Model.

4
00:00:05,754 --> 00:00:08,290
And this is to ensure that you know

5
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,800
what AWS is responsible for,

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,060
and what you are responsible for.

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,130
Now, I want to include some bits of information

8
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,750
within some sections to give you an idea of how

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,010
the shared responsibility model works for AWs.

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,610
So AWS is responsible for everything

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,660
that they do, for example, their infrastructure

12
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,610
and their global network security,

13
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,700
the configuration and vulnerabilty analysis

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,732
of the services they offer,

15
00:00:35,732 --> 00:00:36,565
and any sign of compliance

16
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:38,210
that they are responsible for.

17
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,980
But regarding IAM, you are responsible for a lot

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,875
of things that AWS will not do for you.

19
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:46,310
You are responsible for creating your own users,

20
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,215
your groups, your roles, your policies,

21
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,500
the management of these policies,

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,310
and the monitoring of that.

23
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,280
You are responsible for enabling MFA

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,100
on all accounts and enforcing this, not AWS.

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,150
You are also responsible to make sure

26
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,270
that the keys are rotated often.

27
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,850
You need to make sure that you use the IAM tools

28
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,440
to apply the appropriate permissions,

29
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,410
and again, you are responsible

30
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,250
for analyzing the access patterns

31
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,470
and review the permissions in your accounts,

32
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,880
not AWS.

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,610
So this is a very simple example,

34
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,709
but an obvious one. But AWS is responsible

35
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:21,320
for all the infrastructure,

36
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,331
and you are responsible for how you use

37
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:25,000
that infrastructure.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,190
This is just one of these lectures

39
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,640
on shared responsibility.

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,610
I hope you liked it,

41
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,560
and I will see you in the next lecture.
