1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,880
<v Instructor>So let me show you how to create access keys.</v>

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,460
So I'm gonna CLIck on my username, Stephane,

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,980
and I'm gonna go under Security credentials.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,760
I will scroll down and I will create an access key.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,150
As you can see, there are some selection you need to do

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,460
and based on the selection I'm doing, for example,

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,317
I want access key for the CLI,

8
00:00:19,317 --> 00:00:21,840
AWS is going to have an alternative recommended.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,960
For example, for the CLI, it's better to use CloudShell,

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,520
which I will show you in the next lecture.

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,720
So don't worry about it.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,840
Or to use the CLI V2 and an authentication

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,510
through the IAM Identity Center, which I will not show you

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,550
because it's a bit more complicated.

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,080
So based on what you wanna do,

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,120
if it's local code, application running outside

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,580
of AWS or in AWS and so on,

18
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,740
you will have some recommendation in the bottom.

19
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,420
For now, we're going to use the CLI

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,520
and we'll use these access keys

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,900
and we'll click here to say

22
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,120
I understand the above recommendation

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,920
and I still want to create an access key

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,520
because it is important for you to understand how they are,

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,890
how they work, what they are, and so on.

26
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,200
So let's create this access key

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,200
and now this is the only time you'll be able to have access

28
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,230
to the access key and the secret access key.

29
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,140
So I will go back now to a previous version

30
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,080
of that lecture where you see the old UI, but don't worry,

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,120
nothing changes from that point on.

32
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,690
The first thing I have to do is to configure my AWS CLI.

33
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,120
So I'm going to type aws configure,

34
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,390
and then I am greeted with entering my access key ID.

35
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,990
Very nice. I can just enter this one and press Enter.

36
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,900
And then I'm greeted with entering my secret access key,

37
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,330
which I will enter right here as well.

38
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,320
The default region name.

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,420
So this is a region that is close to you.

40
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,830
I will choose eu-west-1

41
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,440
because I will be doing all my tutorials in eu-west-1

42
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,820
but you will choose your own region

43
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,688
and you can enter your own region name.

44
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:45,060
The region name, by the way,

45
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,630
you can get directly from this dropdown right here.

46
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,460
It shows you the name of the region,

47
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,990
as well as the region code.

48
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,780
So for me, I'm going to use my eu-west-1.

49
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,450
I'll press Enter and then the default output format.

50
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,220
I'll just press Enter as well.

51
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,670
So now my AWS CLI is configured

52
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,950
and so we can have a look at how it works.

53
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,950
We can do aws iam list-users and press Enter.

54
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,980
And this will list all the users in my accounts.

55
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,120
And as we can see,

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,250
the user I have right now is called Stephane.

57
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,490
Here is the user ID, here is the ARN, when it was created

58
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,530
and when the password was last used,

59
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,810
which is very similar to what I would get

60
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,020
if I were to go into this UI right here.

61
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,350
So the management console and the CLI do provide

62
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,243
similar kind of information.

63
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,240
Next, I want to show you what happens

64
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,790
if we remove permissions from our users.

65
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,470
So I'm gonna go to admins

66
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,450
and I'm going to remove the Stephane user

67
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,710
from the group admin.

68
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,580
And so again, if I go back to my user Stephane,

69
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,960
it doesn't have any permissions.

70
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,220
And I did this obviously

71
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,040
with my root accounts, not the other accounts.

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,690
So now if I go into my UI and obviously refresh this page,

73
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,670
I'm going to get an error saying that yes,

74
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,010
I do not have the permissions to do this

75
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,050
but let's try to do the same thing with the CLI.

76
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,980
So we're going to do an iam list-users call

77
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,090
and we get no response because actually it was being denied.

78
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,910
So the CLI permissions are obviously going

79
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,410
to be the exact same

80
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,290
as the permissions you get from the IAM console.

81
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,790
So the takeaway from this lecture

82
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,510
is that you can access AWS using the management console

83
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,450
or using access key and secret access key

84
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,570
that you can configure and then use into the CLI.

85
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,090
So hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.

86
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,140
And obviously, do not forget to add your user back

87
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,700
into the group,

88
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,290
otherwise that would be horrible.

89
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,930
So I'm gonna go into groups, admins

90
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,930
and I'm going to add my Stephane user back into my group.

91
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,090
And now I am an administrator again.

92
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,540
So that's it. I will see you in the next lecture.
