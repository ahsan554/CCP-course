00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,150
<v Instructor>So let's do a quick cleanup just to make sure</v>

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,930
we have a clean slate and that we don't overpay anything

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,750
even though we are in the free tier.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,080
So if you go to the EC2 Dashboard, you will see all

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,300
the resources running in your region.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,770
So I have two running instances.

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,410
I'm going to open this in new tab.

8
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,210
Four volumes and then four key pairs.

9
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,043
You can leave it as is.

10
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:19,890
It doesn't cost you any money, no matter what.

11
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,730
Snapshots, I have two so I will open this in new tab.

12
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,250
And then finally, security group.

13
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,440
As well, it don't cost you any money so I'm going

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,350
to leave them as is.

15
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,290
So for our EC2 instances, you can take them all,

16
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,800
right-click, and then terminate them.

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,633
See, this is very easy.

18
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:35,650
This is the cloud.

19
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,610
Then for the volumes, we have some root EBS volumes

20
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,940
that are going to be deleted as we terminate our instances.

21
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,530
But for these two EBS volumes, I'm going to delete them

22
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,750
as well manually, okay.

23
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,710
And finally, for the snapshots, I can delete

24
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,960
the snapshot right away.

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,570
So I can take these two things, do action,

26
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,730
delete the snapshots, yes.

27
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,400
And then it says this one is not being able to be deleted

28
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,580
because it is in use by an AMI.

29
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,310
So I will say okay, go to AMI on the left-hand side.

30
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,030
I'm going to delete the AMI so I can just deregister it.

31
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,270
I say yes, I want to be deregistering this AMI.

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,050
And back into our snapshots, now I'm able to get this one,

33
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,160
delete it, and say yes. And now we should be good to go.

34
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,170
So if I look at instances, all terminated.

35
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,760
If I look at EBS volumes, none of them.

36
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,380
And snapshots, empty, and AMI, empty.

37
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,860
Okay, that's it for the cleanup.

38
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,690
I'm going to refresh this and as we can see,

39
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,260
we are good to go.

40
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,210
And I will see you in the next lecture.
